When we use @ModelAttribute on a method argument, how does that object gets populated

1. The object may be already available in the model due to use of @SessionAttributes annotation on top of the controller method

2. The object may be already available in the model due to use of @ModelAttribute on top a method in the controller

3. It may be retrieved from the form parameters sent in the http request

4. It will be created using the default constructor of the object if the object could not be retrieved using above three options
